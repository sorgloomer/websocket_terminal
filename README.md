Open one of the following links in a browser:

Local ssh:

# Remarks

Currently only password authentication is supported for ssh. The username and password is sent in plaintext via **http or https** in the default implementation!

# Credits

Thanks to aluzzardi for the wssh project, which inspired this one. The websocket and json based protocol is entirely the same as in wssh.

Greenlet and wsgi implementation: eventlet

Python ssh client: paramiko

Browser side terminal: xterm.js
